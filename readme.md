# Exercises on Arrays, Classes, Objects & Wrapper Classes  

This repository contains a collection of Java exercises designed to practice **core object-oriented programming concepts** such as encapsulation, class design, array manipulation, and wrapper classes.  

---

## 📌 Project Description  

The exercises simulate real-world use cases to illustrate Java fundamentals:  
- Handling **arrays** with iteration and data processing.  
- Implementing **object-oriented design** with classes and objects.  
- Applying **encapsulation** and constructors.  
- Working with **wrapper classes** for primitive data.

## 🔎 File Descriptions

- **BankAccount.java**
Implements a simple bank account system. Demonstrates class design, encapsulation, and methods for deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking.

- **CourseNumbersArray.java**
Works with arrays of course numbers, covering iteration, manipulation, and data processing.

- **DogShelter.java**
Models a dog shelter with basic operations such as adding dogs and listing shelter information.

- **ManageStudent.java**
Entry point for managing multiple students. Demonstrates handling collections of objects, adding/removing students, and printing details.

- **Student.java**
Encapsulates student information. Includes constructors, getters, setters, and demonstrates clean object-oriented design.

## Getting Started
